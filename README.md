# Decoding_Fame

In this project, our objective is to conduct an in-depth analysis of a dataset containing information about Historical Figures. We will focus on crucial attributes such as their birthplace, occupation, age, place of death, the number of citations in various languages, gender, and their Historical Popularity Index. Our goal is to predict how these key features influence the Historical Popularity Index using different regression algorithms. We will then compare the performance of these machine learning models and determine which one provides the most accurate predictions for the data. Additionally, we plan to create interactive dashboards that will enable us to gain a deeper understanding of our dataset and extract valuable insights from it.

Below is the dataset that is used for this purpose:
